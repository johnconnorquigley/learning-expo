# Hack-a-thing
by Connor Quigley CS 98 19W

## Requirements
- NodeJS 12
- Expo CLI
- Git
- Expo app on iPhone or Android


## How to Run

Clone the github repository with `git clone https://github.com/johnconnorquigley/learning-expo`

In terminal, navigate to the directory 'learning-expo' and run 'npm start' on the command line. 

On android, use the expo app to scan the QR code that will appear in the terminal. On ios, use the camera to scan the QR code. 

This will open the project in the expo app on your phone. 



## Overview
My hack-a-thing has 3 features. 

The first is a coin-flipping feature that communicates with an api to determine the result of a coin flip. This part of my hack-a-thing comes straight from an introductory react-native tutorial that can be found here `https://rapidapi.com/blog/create-react-native-app/`

I then extended the application from this tutorial to explore a few more features that I think would be useful in my project. 

The second feature is a button you press that sends you a push notification. This is all it does and I think its funny, but I also thought it was useful for me to learn how to use the expo notification api because I envision my app having scheduling functionality that sends different alerts to the user at scheduled times. 

The final feature is a page of text where everytime you click the text, the text doubles, but the font size decreases. My goal here was to learn how to use hooks in order to have state inside functions and control the information and style of what is being displayed. 

## Overview

React Native and the Expo SDK seem like really great tools for building application front ends and I believe I will use these in my final project.
